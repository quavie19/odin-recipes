        <h2>Fried Jerk Chicken Wings</h2>
            <p>These jerk chicken wings were so flavorful, so different, and so additively delicious, that I may have eaten my last Buffalo wing. 
            Okay, I didn't mean that, but these really are amazing; a perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. </p>
            <p>I'm usually pretty casual about you changing my recipes, but I'm going to have to insist you not change any of the key ingredients, which are, every one of them.</p>
